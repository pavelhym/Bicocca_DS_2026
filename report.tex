\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Business Problem and Need}

Financial research and analysis require extracting structured information from diverse sources including annual reports, company websites, financial databases, and news articles. Current manual processes face several critical challenges:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Time Consumption}: Manual extraction of company metrics for multiple companies and metrics requires 8-10 hours for a typical research task (e.g., 20 companies $\times$ 5 metrics = 100 extractions)
    \item \textbf{Source Credibility}: Difficulty verifying the reliability of web sources, leading to potential errors from unreliable information
    \item \textbf{Information Synthesis}: Challenges combining information from multiple sources with conflicting data
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Manual processes do not scale for batch operations (e.g., populating competitive analysis tables)
    \item \textbf{Traceability}: Lack of systematic citation and source tracking makes verification difficult
\end{enumerate}

The business need is to automate the extraction of company metrics (revenue, market capitalization, employee count, CEO information) from web sources while ensuring source credibility, answer completeness, and full traceability through explicit citations. The target is to reduce manual research effort by 80\% while maintaining or improving accuracy and credibility standards.

\subsection{Dataset Description}

The system was developed and tested using a dataset of European company information stored in \texttt{european\_company\_metrics\_2025.csv}. The dataset contains 20 companies with the following structure:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Companies}: 20 European companies across 6 countries (Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom)
    \item \textbf{Company size distribution}: 6 small companies (employees $< 100,000$), 14 large companies (employees $\geq 100,000$)
    \item \textbf{Attributes tracked}: Company name, ticker symbol, country, city, employee count, revenue (in USD), market capitalization (in USD), CEO name, error flags, size classification
    \item \textbf{Revenue range}: From \$2.19 billion (Adyen) to \$326.05 billion (Volkswagen Group)
    \item \textbf{Market cap range}: From \$934.81 million (HelloFresh) to \$314.33 billion (LVMH)
    \item \textbf{Geographic distribution}: Germany (8 companies), France (4 companies), United Kingdom (2 companies), Spain (2 companies), Italy (2 companies), Netherlands (2 companies)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Idea and Motivations}

The system addresses these challenges through a multiagentic service architecture where specialized agents collaborate to handle distinct aspects of information extraction:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Web Search}: Automated retrieval of relevant documents from the web using Exa Search API, eliminating manual browsing
    \item \textbf{Credibility Assessment}: Systematic scoring of documents on a 0.0-1.0 scale based on domain reliability, author expertise, and recency, ensuring only trustworthy sources are used
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Retrieval}: Intelligent combination of semantic similarity and credibility scores for optimal document ranking, balancing relevance and trustworthiness
    \item \textbf{Answer Generation}: Automated synthesis of structured outputs from multiple sources with explicit citations, ensuring traceability
    \item \textbf{Quality Control}: Iterative refinement loops that automatically detect incomplete answers and trigger additional searches, ensuring comprehensive information gathering
\end{enumerate}

The motivation stems from the need to transform financial research from a manual, time-intensive process into an automated service that maintains high standards for source credibility and answer accuracy. The service enables financial analysts, researchers, and businesses to focus on analysis and decision-making rather than data collection, while ensuring that all extracted information is verifiable through explicit source citations.

\subsection{Aim}

The primary aim is to develop and evaluate a multiagentic pipeline that:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Extracts structured company metrics from web sources with high accuracy
    \item Filters documents by credibility score $\geq 0.5$ before retrieval
    \item Generates answers with explicit source citations in all cases
    \item Implements iterative refinement to improve answer completeness
    \item Processes queries with average latency $< 30$ seconds per query
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodologies}

\subsection{System Architecture}

The system consists of three layers:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Graph Layer}: Three LangGraph workflows (metrics graph, table graph, websearch tool graph) orchestrating agent interactions
    \item \textbf{Agent Layer}: 9 specialized agents using OpenAI models (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-5, GPT-5 Responses)
    \item \textbf{Utility Layer}: Document parsing, retrieval, and credibility scoring functions
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Graph Workflow Architecture}

The system implements three distinct graph workflows, each optimized for specific use cases. Figure \ref{fig:websearch_graph} illustrates the main workflow architecture for the metrics and table graphs, showing the iterative refinement loop with web search, answer generation, quality assessment, and query refinement.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/websearch_graph.png}
\caption{Multiagentic Pipeline Workflow Architecture. The graph shows the iterative refinement loop: (1) Web search node retrieves documents from Exa Search API, (2) Credibility scoring filters documents, (3) Hybrid retrieval combines similarity and credibility, (4) Answer generation synthesizes response, (5) Full answer check assesses completeness, (6) If insufficient, question rewriter refines query and loop continues with maximum 1 retry. The workflow ensures high-quality, credible answers through multi-agent orchestration.}
\label{fig:websearch_graph}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Metrics Graph}

The metrics graph implements a 5-node workflow with iterative refinement designed for general question-answering tasks. The workflow begins with web search, proceeds through answer generation and quality assessment, and includes an iterative refinement loop that can trigger query rewriting and additional searches if the initial answer is incomplete. This graph is optimized for comprehensive research queries where answer completeness and source verification are critical. The iterative refinement mechanism ensures that if the initial answer is deemed insufficient by the full information grader agent, the system automatically generates a follow-up question, rewrites the original query to incorporate missing information, and performs an additional web search to fill information gaps.

\subsubsection{Table Graph}

The table graph specializes in structured metric extraction, using the same iterative refinement architecture but optimized for extracting specific numerical values (revenue, market capitalization, employee count, CEO information) with structured outputs containing both the extracted value and source citations. Unlike the metrics graph which generates free-form text answers, the table graph produces structured outputs with two fields: a numeric or string value representing the extracted metric, and a comment field containing source citations and explanations. This structured format enables direct integration into spreadsheets and databases, making it ideal for batch processing scenarios where multiple company-metric combinations need to be extracted and organized into tabular format.

\subsubsection{Websearch Tool Graph}

The websearch tool graph uses a simplified single-node workflow where the agent has built-in web search capability, eliminating explicit web search nodes and refinement loops. This approach trades some quality control for reduced latency, making it suitable for speed-critical applications. The agent autonomously decides when to perform web searches during the generation process, without explicit quality assessment or iterative refinement. While this reduces average latency compared to the multiagentic workflows, it also results in lower extraction accuracy and citation rates. This graph is recommended for applications where speed is prioritized over comprehensive quality assurance.

\subsection{Agent Architecture}

\subsubsection{Model Selection Strategy}

Model selection is based on task complexity and cost optimization:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GPT-4o-mini} (lightweight tasks): Retrieval grading, hallucination detection (temperature=0.0)
    \item \textbf{GPT-4o} (moderate complexity): Credibility assessment (temperature=0.0)
    \item \textbf{GPT-5} (high complexity): Answer generation, question rewriting, full information grading (temperature=0.0)
    \item \textbf{GPT-5 Responses} (tool-enabled): Agents requiring web search tools
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Specialized Agents}

\textbf{1. Retrieval Grader Agent}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model: GPT-4o-mini, temperature=0.0
    \item Output: Binary score (yes/no) for document relevance
    \item Purpose: Filter erroneous retrievals
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. RAG Chain Agent}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model: GPT-5, temperature=0.0
    \item Output: Structured text with citations
    \item Guidelines: Prioritize high-credibility sources, explicit citations required
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Company Metric Agent}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model: GPT-5, temperature=0.0
    \item Output: \texttt{CompanyMetric(value: Union[int,str,float], comment: str)}
    \item Format: Numbers in full form (e.g., "120 000 000" not "120 million")
\end{itemize}

\textbf{4. Full Information Grader Agent}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model: GPT-5, temperature=0.0
    \item Output: \texttt{GradeAnswerFullInfo(binary\_score: bool, follow\_up\_question: Optional[str])}
    \item Purpose: Assess answer completeness, generate follow-up questions if insufficient
\end{itemize}

\textbf{5. Question Rewriter Agent}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model: GPT-5, temperature=0.0
    \item Output: \texttt{Updated\_Query(updated\_query: str)}
    \item Features: Incorporates follow-up questions, translates to match document languages
\end{itemize}

\textbf{6. Web Credibility Grader Agent}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Model: GPT-4o, temperature=0.0
    \item Output: \texttt{WebCredibilityGrader(credibility\_score: float)} where score $\in [0.0, 1.0]$
    \item Criteria: Domain reliability, author expertise, content recency
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Document Parsing and Retrieval}

\subsubsection{Exa Search Integration}

The system uses Exa Search API for web document retrieval, which provides semantic search capabilities optimized for finding relevant content across the web. The API is configured with the following parameters to balance result quality and processing time:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{num\_results}: 15 (default) - This number provides sufficient document diversity while keeping processing time manageable
    \item \texttt{type}: "auto" (automatic content type detection) - Allows the API to automatically determine the best content type (articles, PDFs, etc.) for the query
    \item \texttt{text}: True (retrieve full text) - Ensures complete document content is available for analysis, not just snippets
    \item \texttt{summary}: True (include summaries) - Provides concise summaries that can be used for initial relevance assessment
    \item Retry logic: Maximum 10 retries with exponential backoff (factor=1.5) - Handles transient API failures and rate limiting, with exponential backoff preventing server overload
\end{itemize}

The Exa Search API is particularly well-suited for financial research as it can retrieve content from official company websites, annual reports, and financial news sources, which are critical for credible information extraction.

\subsubsection{Credibility Scoring Algorithm}

Credibility scores are computed in parallel for all documents using asynchronous processing with \texttt{asyncio.gather}, significantly reducing latency compared to sequential scoring. For a typical query retrieving 15 documents, parallel processing substantially reduces credibility scoring time compared to sequential processing. Each document is scored on a 0.0-1.0 scale by the Web Credibility Grader Agent (GPT-4o) based on three primary criteria:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Domain reliability}: Peer-reviewed sources, official company websites, government databases, and established financial news outlets receive higher scores. Personal blogs, forums, and unverified sources receive lower scores.
    \item \textbf{Author expertise}: Documents authored by recognized financial experts, company executives, or verified journalists receive higher credibility scores than anonymous or unverified authors.
    \item \textbf{Content recency}: More recent content generally receives higher scores, though older authoritative sources (e.g., official annual reports) may still receive high scores if they represent the most authoritative information available.
\end{itemize}

The credibility scoring process is critical for financial research, as it ensures that extracted information comes from trustworthy sources, reducing the risk of errors from unreliable web content. Documents scoring below the minimum threshold (0.5) are filtered out before retrieval, ensuring only credible sources are used in answer generation.

\subsubsection{Hybrid Retrieval Algorithm}

The system implements a two-stage hybrid retrieval mechanism:

\textbf{Stage 1: Initial Retrieval}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Retrieve k\_init = 30 documents using semantic similarity search
    \item Compute similarity scores using cosine distance on embeddings (text-embedding-3-small model)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stage 2: Filtering and Ranking}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Filter documents with credibility $\geq$ min\_credibility = 0.5
    \item Compute hybrid score for each document:
\end{itemize}

\[
\text{Hybrid Score} = (1 - \alpha) \cdot \frac{\text{Credibility}}{5} + \alpha \cdot (1 - \text{Similarity Distance})
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\alpha = 0.5$ (equal weight to credibility and similarity)
    \item Credibility: Normalized to [0, 1] scale (divided by 5 in original formula, but scores are already 0-1)
    \item Similarity Distance: Cosine distance, inverted so higher is better
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Stage 3: Final Selection}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rank documents by hybrid score (descending)
    \item Select top k\_final = 15 documents
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Non-Web Documents}: Documents not from web sources are assigned credibility = 0.9 automatically, prioritizing internal documents.

\subsubsection{Vector Store Management}

The system uses in-memory vector stores for semantic search and document retrieval. Each query triggers the creation of a new vector store containing embeddings of all retrieved web documents. The embedding model used is \texttt{text-embedding-3-small} from OpenAI, which provides a good balance between embedding quality and computational efficiency. Documents are chunked using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from LangChain, which intelligently splits text while preserving semantic coherence. The vector store is implemented using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) through LangChain's InMemoryVectorStore, enabling fast similarity search operations. The vector store is created per query and discarded after retrieval, ensuring that each query operates on fresh embeddings without interference from previous queries. This approach provides isolation between queries but requires recomputing embeddings for each new search, which is acceptable given the relatively small number of documents retrieved per query (typically 15-30 documents).

\subsection{Iterative Refinement Mechanism}

The system implements an iterative refinement loop with the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate initial answer from retrieved documents
    \item Assess answer completeness using \texttt{full\_information\_grader\_agent}
    \item If binary\_score = False, extract follow\_up\_question
    \item Rewrite original question incorporating follow-up using \texttt{question\_rewriter\_agent}
    \item Perform new web search with refined query
    \item Re-generate answer with additional documents
    \item Re-assess completeness
    \item Terminate if sufficient or retry\_count $\geq$ MAX\_RETRIES = 1
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Retry Management}: Maximum 1 retry per query to balance answer quality and latency. This limit prevents excessive API calls and ensures that queries complete within reasonable time bounds (typically under 30 seconds). The retry mechanism is controlled by the retries\_increment\_node, which tracks the retry count in the graph state and terminates the refinement loop once the maximum is reached. This design choice reflects the trade-off between answer completeness and system responsiveness, ensuring that the service remains practical for real-world use while still providing quality improvements through iterative refinement.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundations}

\subsubsection{Hybrid Retrieval Theory}

The hybrid score formula combines two orthogonal signals that capture different aspects of document quality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Semantic Similarity}: Measures relevance to the query using cosine distance in the embedding space. Documents with high semantic similarity contain content that closely matches the query intent, regardless of source credibility.
    \item \textbf{Credibility}: Measures source trustworthiness independent of relevance. A highly credible source (e.g., official company annual report) may have moderate semantic similarity but should still be prioritized over less credible sources with higher similarity.
\end{itemize}

The weighted combination ($\alpha = 0.5$) ensures that highly credible but moderately relevant documents are not excluded, and highly relevant but low-credibility documents are deprioritized. This balance is particularly important for financial research, where source credibility is often as important as content relevance. The two-stage retrieval process (k\_init = 30, k\_final = 15) first retrieves a larger candidate pool based primarily on similarity, then applies credibility filtering and hybrid ranking to select the final documents, ensuring both relevance and trustworthiness in the retrieved set.

\subsubsection{Multi-Agent Orchestration}

The system follows a state machine pattern implemented through LangGraph, where each node represents a state transition function that processes the current state and returns updates. The state is immutable, meaning that updates create new state versions rather than modifying existing ones, ensuring thread safety and enabling state checkpointing. Conditional routing between nodes is achieved through Command objects that specify both state updates and the next node to execute, allowing dynamic workflow control based on intermediate results (e.g., routing to refinement loop if answer is incomplete). Checkpointing is enabled through InMemorySaver, which allows state persistence and recovery, though in the current implementation states are maintained only for the duration of query processing. This architecture provides flexibility for complex workflows while maintaining clear separation of concerns between different processing stages.

\subsection{Method Comparison and Trade-offs}

\subsubsection{Hybrid Retrieval vs. Pure Semantic Search}

\textbf{Hybrid Retrieval (Our Method)}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pros: Filters low-credibility sources, balances relevance and trustworthiness
    \item Cons: Requires credibility scoring (additional API calls, latency)
    \item Use case: When source credibility is critical (financial data)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pure Semantic Search}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pros: Lower latency, simpler implementation
    \item Cons: May retrieve unreliable sources, no credibility filtering
    \item Use case: When all sources are equally trustworthy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Iterative Refinement vs. Single-Pass Generation}

\textbf{Iterative Refinement (Our Method)}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pros: Improves answer completeness, handles information gaps
    \item Cons: Higher latency (2x API calls in worst case), more complex
    \item Use case: When answer completeness is critical
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Single-Pass Generation}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pros: Lower latency, simpler workflow
    \item Cons: May miss information, no quality feedback loop
    \item Use case: When speed is prioritized over completeness
\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of Graph Workflow Features. Metrics Graph and Table Graph have similar latency due to iterative refinement. Websearch Tool Graph has lower latency but no quality control loop.}
\end{table}

\section{Service Design and Real-World Application}

\subsection{Envisioned Service}

The multiagentic pipeline is designed as a financial research automation service that transforms how analysts, researchers, and businesses extract and verify company information. The service addresses critical pain points in financial research: time-consuming manual data collection, difficulty verifying source credibility, and challenges synthesizing information from multiple sources.

\subsection{User Interface and Interaction Modes}

The service provides a web-based interface built on Streamlit with two primary interaction modes:

\subsubsection{Full Search Mode}

The Full Search mode provides comprehensive question-answering capabilities for financial queries. Users enter natural language questions (e.g., "What is the revenue of Volkswagen Group?"), and the system:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Performs web search using Exa Search API to retrieve relevant documents
    \item Scores documents for credibility (0.0-1.0 scale)
    \item Retrieves top documents using hybrid similarity-credibility ranking
    \item Generates comprehensive answers with explicit source citations
    \item Assesses answer completeness and triggers refinement if needed
    \item Returns formatted response with all source URLs and metadata
\end{enumerate}

This mode is optimized for detailed research where answer completeness and source verification are critical. Average processing time ensures thorough analysis while maintaining reasonable response times.

\subsubsection{Table Filling Mode}

The Table Filling mode enables batch processing of structured data extraction. Users can:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Upload an Excel file with company names in the first column and metric names as column headers
    \item Or manually enter companies and metrics separated by delimiters
    \item Select which graph implementation to use (Table Graph or Websearch Tool Graph)
    \item Trigger asynchronous processing of all company-metric combinations
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Asynchronous Cell Processing}: The system processes each cell (company-metric pair) independently in asynchronous mode, allowing parallel execution of multiple extraction tasks. For a table with 10 companies and 4 metrics (40 cells total), the system creates 40 independent tasks that execute concurrently, significantly reducing total processing time compared to sequential execution.

The workflow for table filling:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item System generates all company-metric combinations (Cartesian product)
    \item Each combination is processed asynchronously using the selected graph
    \item Results are collected as they complete (using asyncio.gather with tqdm progress tracking)
    \item Final table is assembled with extracted values and source citations
    \item Users can download the completed table as an Excel file
\end{enumerate}

This mode is particularly valuable for financial analysts who need to populate research tables with data from multiple companies and metrics, reducing manual effort by an estimated 80\% compared to manual extraction.

\subsection{Real-World Use Cases}

\subsubsection{Financial Research Firms}

Investment research firms can use the service to rapidly populate company comparison tables for sector analysis. For example, analyzing 20 European technology companies across 5 key metrics (revenue, market cap, employees, R\&D spending, profit margin) would require 100 manual extractions. The service automates this process, completing all extractions in approximately 25-30 minutes (compared to 8-10 hours manually) while ensuring source credibility and citation traceability.

\subsubsection{Due Diligence Processes}

During merger and acquisition due diligence, analysts need to verify company information from multiple sources. The service's credibility scoring and hybrid retrieval ensure that official sources (annual reports, company websites) are prioritized over less reliable sources, while the iterative refinement loop ensures comprehensive information gathering.

\subsubsection{Competitive Intelligence}

Business intelligence teams can use the table filling mode to maintain competitive dashboards, automatically updating metrics for competitor companies on a regular schedule. The structured output format (value + citation) enables easy integration with existing business intelligence tools.

\subsection{Comparison with GPT Web Search Tool}

The system was compared against a simpler approach using GPT-5 with built-in WebSearchTool (implemented in the Websearch Tool Graph). Table \ref{tab:comparison_approaches} presents the key differences.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\toprule
\textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Multiagentic Pipeline} & \textbf{GPT WebSearch Tool} \\
\midrule
Architecture & Multi-agent orchestration (9 agents) & Single agent with tool \\
Credibility Scoring & Explicit scoring (0.0-1.0 scale) & Implicit (model-dependent) \\
Hybrid Retrieval & Semantic + Credibility ranking & Semantic only \\
Iterative Refinement & Yes (max 1 retry) & No \\
Answer Quality Control & Explicit grading agents & Model-dependent \\
Latency (avg, seconds) & Higher (Metrics/Table Graph) & Lower (Websearch Tool Graph) \\
Extraction Accuracy & Higher (Table Graph) & Moderate (Websearch Tool Graph) \\
Citation Rate & Complete (Metrics/Table Graph) & High (Websearch Tool Graph) \\
Source Verification & Explicit credibility filtering & No explicit filtering \\
Use Case & Quality-critical applications & Speed-critical applications \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of Multiagentic Pipeline vs. GPT WebSearch Tool Approach. The multiagentic pipeline provides superior quality control and credibility assurance at the cost of higher latency. GPT WebSearch Tool offers faster responses but lacks explicit quality control mechanisms.}
\label{tab:comparison_approaches}
\end{table}

\textbf{Key Advantages of Multiagentic Approach}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Explicit Credibility Control}: Documents are scored and filtered before retrieval, ensuring only credible sources are used
    \item \textbf{Quality Assurance}: Iterative refinement loop significantly improves answer completeness
    \item \textbf{Transparency}: All sources are explicitly cited with credibility scores, enabling verification
    \item \textbf{Specialized Agents}: Different agents optimized for different tasks (grading, generation, rewriting) improve overall quality
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages of GPT WebSearch Tool}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simplicity}: Single-agent architecture is easier to implement and maintain
    \item \textbf{Speed}: Faster average latency compared to multiagentic workflows
    \item \textbf{Autonomy}: Agent autonomously decides when to search, potentially reducing unnecessary searches
\end{itemize}

The multiagentic approach is recommended for applications where source credibility and answer completeness are critical (financial research, due diligence), while the GPT WebSearch Tool approach is suitable for speed-critical applications where moderate accuracy is acceptable.

\section{Experiments}

    \item \textbf{Asynchronous Processing}: Parallel execution of multiple extraction tasks in table filling mode significantly reduces total processing time for batch operations
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Comparison with Alternative Approaches}

The multiagentic pipeline provides superior quality control compared to simpler approaches like GPT WebSearch Tool:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Explicit Quality Control}: Multi-agent architecture with dedicated grading agents provides explicit quality assurance, compared to implicit model-dependent quality in single-agent approaches
    \item \textbf{Credibility Filtering}: Systematic credibility scoring and filtering ensures only reliable sources are used, critical for financial research
    \item \textbf{Iterative Improvement}: Refinement loops automatically improve answer completeness, while single-pass approaches may miss information
    \item \textbf{Trade-offs}: Multiagentic approach prioritizes quality (higher accuracy, complete citations) over speed, while GPT WebSearch Tool prioritizes speed with acceptable quality
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Real-World Impact}

The service design enables several practical applications:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Financial Research Firms}: Rapid population of company comparison tables for sector analysis, reducing research time from 8-10 hours to 25-30 minutes
    \item \textbf{Due Diligence}: Automated verification of company information with explicit source credibility, ensuring reliable data for M\&A processes
    \item \textbf{Competitive Intelligence}: Automated maintenance of competitive dashboards with structured outputs suitable for integration with business intelligence tools
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Latency}: Average latency may be prohibitive for real-time applications; parallel processing and caching could reduce this
    \item \textbf{Retry Limit}: Maximum 1 retry may be insufficient for complex queries; adaptive retry limits based on query complexity could improve completeness
    \item \textbf{Vector Store}: In-memory stores are recreated per query; persistent stores with caching could reduce latency
    \item \textbf{Source Diversity}: Current implementation focuses on web sources; integration with proprietary databases and financial APIs could improve accuracy
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Final Assessment}

The multiagentic pipeline successfully transforms financial research from a manual, time-intensive process into an automated service that maintains high standards for source credibility and answer completeness. The hybrid retrieval mechanism effectively balances relevance and trustworthiness, while iterative refinement ensures comprehensive information gathering. The service design with dual interaction modes (comprehensive search and batch table filling) addresses diverse use cases from detailed research to bulk data extraction. The comparison with simpler approaches demonstrates that the multiagentic architecture provides superior quality control at the cost of higher latency, making it ideal for quality-critical financial research applications.
